## Notes from YouTube Videos
### (How to PASS the OSCP Exam - You're probably not preparing like you should be!)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLNYc-1ScdU]
* Use "Triage" methodology- go for highest priority ports and look at others if you aren't able to find an exploit there.
* Highest priority ports are 8080, 21, 22, 80, 88, 443, 445
* Automate basic recon with tools like (AutoRecon)[https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon] and (Legion)[https://www.kali.org/tools/legion/]
* The OSCP will have many rabbit holes so keep your initial recon short and effective to avoid them
* Set a timer when trying to exploit something and if you don't make any progress by the time the timer goes off, try something else
* At start of exam, run autorecon/legion scan against all targets 
* Rembember that the OSCP is different than a CTF- you are limited on time and you have multiple machines to go through
   * Look at one machine for a while. If you get stuck/run out of ideas, move to another
   * There's lots of other stuff to looks at, don't waste time spinning your wheels
* You should sleep during the exam. Time has been built in for you to rest/sleep, you have more than enough time to do what you need to.
* Highly reccommends to have a good understanding of chisel and SSH tunneling before going into the exam.
* If you find valid credentials, you should be trying them everywhere
* The OSCP exam heavily favors exploit-db. If your exploit is not on exploit-db, chances are that it is not the intended route.
   * If you find an exploit on ExploitDB and the version doesn't match, that's a **rabbit hole** 99% of the time.
   * Consider coming back to it later if you found absolutely nothing else
* LFI checklist
   * Check if the LFI is an RFI for an easy RCE
   * If not, try to look for config files/files **with credentials**
   * On Linux, look for /etc/passwd and search in the user's .ssh/id_rsa file for a private ssh key
   * On Windows, see if you can get a copy of the SAM and SYSTEM files through the repair folder (C:\Windows\System32\config\RegBack) which sometimes contains backups
      * You can't directly access the SAM and SYSTEM FILES while the system is running, even if you are SYSTEM
   * Look for Apache logs and see if you can inject a PHP payload for command execution (log poisoning)
* It's common in the OSCP exam for an exploit to require some modification before it can work.
